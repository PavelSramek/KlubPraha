Respectable Mr. Secretary,

On November 4th I have submitted a request for access for following information: 

1) list of contractors of the Office of the MEP Miroslav Poche who received payments from Jan 1, 2014 until today,

2) list of contracts with Mr. Karel Březina (supposedly a contractor under 1) and a sum of payments made under each of these
contracts and the documents provided to the Office of MEP Miroslav Poche in fullwilling of each of these contracts by Mr. Karel
Březina.

On December 10th I have received a letter from the European Parliament signed by you, confirming that the European Parliament cannot provide this information publicly. The European Parliament have confirmed that as a person requesting the acceess I have not confirmed the necessity of having the data transferred according to the section 8 (b) of the EC regulation No 45/2001, so there is no reason to assume that the data subject's legitimate interests might be prejudiced. 

It should be mentioned however that Mr. Karel Březina is the chairman of the group of Social Democrats (ČSSD) in the Prague City Hall, the same local authority body I am a member as well. 

Mr. Březina was sentenced in 2014 for fraud by the District Court of Prague 9. As a long-term member of the Social Democrat party, leader of the deputies group in the Prague City Hall, former assistant of the Prime Minister of the Czech Republic, secretary in the Social Democrat party and also the former Minister without portfoilo, it is assumable that financial whereabouts are subject to public interest.
