Respectable Mr. Secretary,

On November 4th I have submitted a request for access for following information: 

1) list of contractors of the Office of the MEP Miroslav Poche who received payments from Jan 1, 2014 until today,

2) list of contracts with Mr. Karel Březina (supposedly a contractor under 1) and a sum of payments made under each of these
contracts and the documents provided to the Office of MEP Miroslav Poche in fullwilling of each of these contracts by Mr. Karel
Březina.

On December 10th I have received a letter from the European Parliament signed by you, confirming that the European Parliament cannot provide this information publicly. The European Parliament have confirmed that as a person requesting the acceess I have not confirmed the necessity of having the data transferred according to the section 8 (b) of the EC regulation No 45/2001, so there is no reason to assume that the data subject's legitimate interests might be prejudiced. 

Pursuant sections 8 (a) and (b) of the EC regulation No. 45/2001 I hereby estabilish the necessity of having the data transferred based on the following statements:

Mr. Březina was sentenced in 2014 for fraud by the District Court of Prague 9. Mr. Březina is also a long-term member of the Social Democrat party, leader of the deputies group in the Prague City Hall, former assistant of the Prime Minister of the Czech Republic, secretary in the Social Democrat party and also the former Minister without portfoilo. As a politician, he is a subject of the public control in the Czech society. Such a public control thus makes it imperative that his financial whereabouts are subject to public interest in the Czech Republic. 

Mr. Březina is currently a member of Sports Grants Committee of the Prague City Council; he does not occupy any more significant political functions due to a fact that his political position is compromised, given the trial in 2014 mentioned above.

Former member of the European Parliament Miroslav Poche is also the former deputy in the Prague City Hall and former Chairman of the Social Democrat group. He is a close ally of Karel Březina. In 2010 both of them supported each other in spite of calls of Presidency of the Social Democrat Party. Both politicians are well known for being influential and present for several consecutive political terms in the Prague politics as deputies. Therefore it is reasonable to assume, that given the nature of their cooperation in the past ₋ and given the public interest on this topic in 2010 till 2014, such information should be provided.
