Dear European Parliament,

Under the right of access to documents in the EU treaties, as
developed in Regulation 1049/2001, I am requesting documents which
contain the following information:

1) list of contractors of the Office of the MEP Miroslav Poche who
received payments from Jan 1, 2014 until today,

2) list of contracts with Mr. Karel Březina (supposedly a
contractor under 1) and a sum of payments made under each of these
contracts and the documents provided to the Office of MEP Miroslav
Poche in fullwilling of each of these contracts by Mr. Karel
Březina,

Yours faithfully,

Jakub Michalek
