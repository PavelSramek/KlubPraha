Dear Ms. Wang,

We as the Pirate Group in the Prague City Hall feel pleased by the support of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in Prague. We do believe that a statement that was included in the clause, supporting the One China Policy as the People's Republic of China defines it, is clearly a statement we don't think should be added in a partnership agreement. That is why we have voted together with several other parties against the proposal. 

We believe that there is an interest within the leading coalition in Prague to appeal to the People's Republic of China in order to attract chinese enterpreneurs, so that they will invest more in Prague. That alone should not be seen as a problem, but we fear much more a possible connection between the interests Government of PRC and the leading parties in the Prague coallition. In essence - we disagree with a scenario, where some parties in the Prague coalition will act as a proxy of the PRC government. 

There is of course much more to this, and that is why I would like to discuss this matter in person in our office here in the Prague City Hall (no. 40) on Wednesday 16th March 15:00. 

Best regards,
